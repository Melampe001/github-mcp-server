## Remote GitHub MCP Server

[![Install in VS Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code-Install_Server-0098FF?style=flat-square&logo=visualstudiocode&logoColor=white)](https://insiders.vscode.dev/redirect/mcp/install?name=github&config=%7B%22type%22%3A%20%22http%22%2C%22url%22%3A%20%22https%3A%2F%2Fapi.githubcopilot.com%2Fmcp%2F%22%7D) [![Install in VS Code Insiders](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code_Insiders-Install_Server-24bfa5?style=flat-square&logo=visualstudiocode&logoColor=white)](https://insiders.vscode.dev/redirect/mcp/install?name=github&config=%7B%22type%22%3A%20%22http%22%2C%22url%22%3A%20%22https%3A%2F%2Fapi.githubcopilot.com%2Fmcp%2F%22%7D&quality=insiders)

The remote GitHub MCP Server is hosted by GitHub and provides the easiest method for getting up and running. If your MCP host does not support remote MCP servers, don't worry! You can use the [local version of the GitHub MCP Server](https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server?tab=readme-ov-file#local-github-mcp-server) instead.

### Prerequisites

1. A compatible MCP host with remote server support (VS Code 1.101+, Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.)
2. Any applicable [policies enabled](https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server/blob/main/docs/policies-and-governance.md)

### Install in VS Code

For quick installation, use one of the one-click install buttons above. Once you complete that flow, toggle Agent mode (located by the Copilot Chat text input) and the server will start. Make sure you're using [VS Code 1.101](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_101) or [later](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates) for remote MCP and OAuth support.

Alternatively, to manually configure VS Code, choose the appropriate JSON block from the examples below and add it to your host configuration:

<table>
<tr><th>Using OAuth</th><th>Using a GitHub PAT</th></tr>
<tr><th align=left colspan=2>VS Code (version 1.101 or greater)</th></tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td>

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "github": {

      "url": "https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/"
    }
  }
}
```

> **Note:** Each MCP host application needs to configure a GitHub App or OAuth App to support remote access via OAuth. Any host application that supports remote MCP servers should support the remote GitHub server with PAT authentication. Configuration details and support levels vary by host. Make sure to refer to the host application's documentation for more info.

### Configuration

#### Toolset configuration

See [Remote Server Documentation](docs/remote-server.md) for full details on remote server configuration, toolsets, headers, and advanced usage. This file provides comprehensive instructions and examples for connecting, customizing, and installing the remote GitHub MCP Server in VS Code and other MCP hosts.

When no toolsets are specified, [default toolsets](#default-toolset) are used.

#### Enterprise Cloud with data residency (ghe.com)

GitHub Enterprise Cloud can also make use of the remote server.

Example for `https://octocorp.ghe.com`:
```
{
    ...
    "proxima-github": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://copilot-api.octocorp.ghe.com/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer ${input:github_mcp_pat}"
      }
    },
    ...
}
```

GitHub Enterprise Server does not support remote server hosting. Please refer to [GitHub Enterprise Server and Enterprise Cloud with data residency (ghe.com)](#github-enterprise-server-and-enterprise-cloud-with-data-residency-ghecom) from the local server configuration.

### Prerequisites

1. To run the server in a container, you will need to have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed.
2. Once Docker is installed, you will also need to ensure Docker is running. The image is public; if you get errors on pull, you may have an expired token and need to `docker logout ghcr.io`.
3. Lastly you will need to [Create a GitHub Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new).
The MCP server can use many of the GitHub APIs, so enable the permissions that you feel comfortable granting your AI tools (to learn more about access tokens, please check out the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens)).

<details><summary><b>Handling PATs Securely</b></summary>

### Environment Variables (Recommended)
To keep your GitHub PAT secure and reusable across different MCP hosts:

1. **Store your PAT in environment variables**
   ```bash
   export GITHUB_PAT=your_token_here
   ```
   Or create a `.env` file:
   ```env
   GITHUB_PAT=your_token_here
   ```

2. **Protect your `.env` file**
   ```bash
   # Add to .gitignore to prevent accidental commits
   echo ".env" >> .gitignore
   ```

3. **Reference the token in configurations**
   ```bash
   # CLI usage
   claude mcp update github -e GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=$GITHUB_PAT

   # In config files (where supported)
   "env": {
     "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "$GITHUB_PAT"
   }
   ```

> **Note**: Environment variable support varies by host app and IDE. Some applications (like Windsurf) require hardcoded tokens in config files.

### Token Security Best Practices

- **Minimum scopes**: Only grant necessary permissions
  - `repo` - Repository operations
  - `read:packages` - Docker image access
  - `read:org` - Organization team access
- **Separate tokens**: Use different PATs for different projects/environments
- **Regular rotation**: Update tokens periodically
- **Never commit**: Keep tokens out of version control
- **File permissions**: Restrict access to config files containing tokens
  ```bash
  chmod 600 ~/.your-app/config.json
  ```

</details>

### GitHub Enterprise Server and Enterprise Cloud with data residency (ghe.com)

The flag `--gh-host` and the environment variable `GITHUB_HOST` can be used to set
the hostname for GitHub Enterprise Server or GitHub Enterprise Cloud with data residency.

- For GitHub Enterprise Server, prefix the hostname with the `https://` URI scheme, as it otherwise defaults to `http://`, which GitHub Enterprise Server does not support.
- For GitHub Enterprise Cloud with data residency, use `https://YOURSUBDOMAIN.ghe.com` as the hostname.
``` json
"github": {
    "command": "docker",
    "args": [
    "run",
    "-i",
    "--rm",
    "-e",
    "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN",
    "-e",
    "GITHUB_HOST",
    "ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server"
    ],
    "env": {
        "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "${input:github_token}",
        "GITHUB_HOST": "https://<your GHES or ghe.com domain name>"
    }
}
```

## Installation

### Install in GitHub Copilot on VS Code

For quick installation, use one of the one-click install buttons above. Once you complete that flow, toggle Agent mode (located by the Copilot Chat text input) and the server will start.

More about using MCP server tools in VS Code's [agent mode documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers).

Install in GitHub Copilot on other IDEs (JetBrains, Visual Studio, Eclipse, etc.)

Add the following JSON block to your IDE's MCP settings.

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "inputs": [
      {
        "type": "promptString",
        "id": "github_token",
        "description": "GitHub Personal Access Token",
        "password": true
      }
    ],
    "servers": {
      "github": {
        "command": "docker",
        "args": [
          "run",
          "-i",
          "--rm",
          "-e",
          "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN",
          "ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server"
        ],
        "env": {
          "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "${input:github_token}"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Optionally, you can add a similar example (i.e. without the mcp key) to a file called `.vscode/mcp.json` in your workspace. This will allow you to share the configuration with other host applications that accept the same format.

{
  "inputs": [
    {
      "type": "promptString",
      "id": "github_token",
      "description": "GitHub Personal Access Token",
      "password": true
    }
  ],
  "servers": {
    "github": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "--rm",
        "-e",
        "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN",
        "ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server"
      ],
      "env": {
        "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "${input:github_token}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

### Install in Other MCP Hosts

For other MCP host applications, please refer to our installation guides:

- **[GitHub Copilot in other IDEs](/docs/installation-guides/install-other-copilot-ides.md)** - Installation for JetBrains, Visual Studio, Eclipse, and Xcode with GitHub Copilot
- **[Claude Code & Claude Desktop](docs/installation-guides/install-claude.md)** - Installation guide for Claude Code and Claude Desktop

- **[Google Gemini CLI](docs/installation-guides/install-gemini-cli.md)** - Installation guide for Google Gemini CLI
- **[Windsurf](docs/installation-guides/install-windsurf.md)** - Installation guide for Windsurf IDE

For a complete overview of all installation options, see our **[Installation Guides Index](docs/installation-guides)**.

> **Note:** Any host application that supports local MCP servers should be able to access the local GitHub MCP server. However, the specific configuration process, syntax and stability of the integration will vary by host application. While many may follow a similar format to the examples above, this is not guaranteed. Please refer to your host application's documentation for the correct MCP configuration syntax and setup process.

### Build from source

If you don't have Docker, you can use `go build` to build the binary in the
`cmd/github-mcp-server` directory, and use the `github-mcp-server stdio` command with the `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable set to your token. To specify the output location of the build, use the `-o` flag. You should configure your server to use the built executable as its `command`. For example:

```JSON
{
  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "github": {
        "command": "/path/to/github-mcp-server",
        "args": ["stdio"],
        "env": {
          "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "<YOUR_TOKEN>"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Tool Configuration

The GitHub MCP Server supports enabling or disabling specific groups of functionalities via the `--toolsets` flag. This allows you to control which GitHub API capabilities are available to your AI tools. Enabling only the toolsets that you need can help the LLM with tool choice and reduce the context size.

_Toolsets are not limited to Tools. Relevant MCP Resources and Prompts are also included where applicable._

When no toolsets are specified, [default toolsets](#default-toolset) are used.

#### Specifying Toolsets

To specify toolsets you want available to the LLM, you can pass an allow-list in two ways:

1. **Using Command Line Argument**:

   ```bash
   github-mcp-server --toolsets repos,issues,pull_requests,actions,code_security
   ```

2. **Using Environment Variable**:
   ```bash
   GITHUB_TOOLSETS="repos,issues,pull_requests,actions,code_security" ./github-mcp-server
   ```

The environment variable `GITHUB_TOOLSETS` takes precedence over the command line argument if both are provided.

### Using Toolsets With Docker

When using Docker, you can pass the toolsets as environment variables:

```bash
docker run -i --rm \
  -e GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=<your-token> \
  -e GITHUB_TOOLSETS="repos,issues,pull_requests,actions,code_security,experiments" \
  ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server
```

### Special toolsets

#### "all" toolset

The special toolset `all` can be provided to enable all available toolsets regardless of any other configuration:

```bash
./github-mcp-server --toolsets all
```

Or using the environment variable:

```bash
GITHUB_TOOLSETS="all" ./github-mcp-server
```

#### "default" toolset
The default toolset `default` is the configuration that gets passed to the server if no toolsets are specified.

The default configuration is:
- context
- repos
- issues
- pull_requests
- users

To keep the default configuration and add additional toolsets:

```bash
GITHUB_TOOLSETS="default,stargazers" ./github-mcp-server
```

### Available Toolsets

The following sets of tools are available:

## Dynamic Tool Discovery

**Note**: This feature is currently in beta and may not be available in all environments. Please test it out and let us know if you encounter any issues.

Instead of starting with all tools enabled, you can turn on dynamic toolset discovery. Dynamic toolsets allow the MCP host to list and enable toolsets in response to a user prompt. This should help to avoid situations where the model gets confused by the sheer number of tools available.

### Using Dynamic Tool Discovery

When using the binary, you can pass the `--dynamic-toolsets` flag.

```bash
./github-mcp-server --dynamic-toolsets
```

When using Docker, you can pass the toolsets as environment variables:

```bash
docker run -i --rm \
  -e GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=<your-token> \
  -e GITHUB_DYNAMIC_TOOLSETS=1 \
  ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server
```

## Read-Only Mode

To run the server in read-only mode, you can use the `--read-only` flag. This will only offer read-only tools, preventing any modifications to repositories, issues, pull requests, etc.

```bash
./github-mcp-server --read-only
```

When using Docker, you can pass the read-only mode as an environment variable:

```bash
docker run -i --rm \
  -e GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=<your-token> \
  -e GITHUB_READ_ONLY=1 \
  ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server
```

## i18n / Overriding Descriptions

The descriptions of the tools can be overridden by creating a
`github-mcp-server-config.json` file in the same directory as the binary.

The file should contain a JSON object with the tool names as keys and the new
descriptions as values. For example:

```json
{
  "TOOL_ADD_ISSUE_COMMENT_DESCRIPTION": "an alternative description",
  "TOOL_CREATE_BRANCH_DESCRIPTION": "Create a new branch in a GitHub repository"
}
```

You can create an export of the current translations by running the binary with
the `--export-translations` flag.

This flag will preserve any translations/overrides you have made, while adding
any new translations that have been added to the binary since the last time you
exported.

```sh
./github-mcp-server --export-translations
cat github-mcp-server-config.json
```

You can also use ENV vars to override the descriptions. The environment
variable names are the same as the keys in the JSON file, prefixed with
`GITHUB_MCP_` and all uppercase.

For example, to override the `TOOL_ADD_ISSUE_COMMENT_DESCRIPTION` tool, you can
set the following environment variable:

```sh
export GITHUB_MCP_TOOL_ADD_ISSUE_COMMENT_DESCRIPTION="an alternative description"
```

## Library Usage

The exported Go API of this module should currently be considered unstable, and subject to breaking changes. In the future, we may offer stability; please file an issue if there is a use case where this would be valuable.

Con descripción para los usuarios y guías ilustradas, sonidos, animaciones, fichas con valores de $2, $2.5, $4, $5, $10, $20, $50, $100, $200, $500, $1K, $2.5K, $5K y $10K. 100% real  off line. Para evitar acciones en contra de la ley. 
Esta App Predictora de resultados: se basa en Las ruletas qué usan RNG (Random Number Generator) verdadero, que es impredecible diseño (es aleatorio y justo). No se puede predecir con certeza, pero podemos crear un simulador/clon que:
 Genera spins aleatorios usando RNG en código.
 Analiza historia de spins para sugerir "predicciones" basadas en patrones estadísticos (como números calientes/fríos, y sus demás secciones para que los puedes ver el jugador. ), aunque esto es solo para simulación y no garantiza ganancias reales (es la falacia del jugador).
 Estrategias: Apis usadas en casinos reales tales como novibet, Mexlucky, Fundalor, Betmaster, etc
 RNG: Usaremos el RNG nativo de Kotlin/Java para generar números aleatorios, 
 Martingale: Estrategia de apuestas donde doblas la apuesta tras una pérdida, para recuperar en la siguiente ganancia. La implementaremos en el simulador.
 PRACMATIC (asumiendo Pragmatic Play): Pragmatic es un proveedor de juegos de casino. No podemos integrar su API real en una app personal (requiere licencias, credenciales y es para operadores de casinos, no usuarios individuales; cuesta miles de dólares y viola términos si se hace sin permiso). En cambio, simularemos un estilo similar casi igual a sus ruletas (como Lucky 6 o Mega Roulette, wc ), basado en descripciones públicas.
 La app se desarrolla en Kotlin usando Android Studio. Te proporcionaré el código fuente completo para que lo compiles e instales. Necesitas:
 Instalar Android Studio (gratuito).
 Crear un nuevo proyecto vacío.
 Copiar los archivos que te doy.
 Compilar y correr en emulador adaptado: Android, ios, lap portátil, lap de escritorio, tabletas, etc
 No requiere permisos especiales.
 Advertencia importante: Esto es un simulador educativo y de entretenimiento. Mayores de 18 años. No es para apuestas reales, ya que las ruletas en casinos online son reguladas y no PREDECIBLES. AVISO IMPORTANTE: El gambling puede ser adictivo; juega responsablemente. No garantiza ganancias; el RNG es aleatorio.
 Cómo usar el código
 Abre Android Studio, crea un nuevo proyecto "Empty Activity" con Kotlin y todo lo necesario para su perfecta fusión de entretenimiento nivel real. 
 Reemplaza los archivos en app/src/main con los que te doy.
 Agrega dependencias en build.gradle.kts (módulo app):
 dependencies {
   implementation("androidx.core:core-ktx:1.13.1")
   implementation("androidx.appcompat:appcompat:1.7.0")
   implementation("com.google.android.material:material:1.12.0")
   implementation("androidx.constraintlayout:constraintlayout:2.1.4")
   // Para gráficos simples (ruleta)
   implementation("com.github.PhilJay:MPAndroidChart:v3.1.0")
 }
 Sync Gradle, build y run.
 La app tendrá:
 Selección de ruleta (Europea/Americana).
 Botón para spin (genera RNG).
 Historia de spins hasta 10000 tiros almacenados para tu récord personal, estadísticas de aciertos y perdidas, 
 Predicción: Sugiere números basados en frecuencia (calientes).
 Martingale: Simula apuestas, dobla en pérdidas.
 Simulación Pragmátic Play.
